** second level
*** third level
** second level again
* first level again</pre><h3>numbered list:</h3>i really like the auto-incrementing register thingy, but it may suffer from addition function, so we use both versions: CommonMark/Original and auto. auto uses '+' for incrementing and standard indentation for inner numeration.
<h3>quotes:</h3><p>both versions are good — the CommonMark/Original uses '>', the other one — ‘"’.
<h3>table:</h3><p>outline, simile to MarkedText.<p>other variants are too hard to parse and do not represent the info well enough.<p><pre>e.g. of MT table
!first row
  !second column
    !third column
!second row
  !- list in second column (why would anyone need a list in a table?)
   - another note
   - and another
    !+ numbered list in third column
     + another note
     + and anothers
!i am a cow
  !etc.
